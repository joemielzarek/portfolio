            <h3 class="legend">In the cavernous land known as Saint Paul, lives a mythical beast like none other. This beast is the legendary guardian of the powerful Multifarious Crystal.<br /><br />Researchers have searched the globe for this magnificent gem which is made up of creativity, development and communication skills. <br /><br />Elders say this unique treasure is gone forever, destroyed in The Great Millennium Battle after the vile Selfie monster defeated the Generation X Warriors, the original keepers of the crystal. <br /><br />To this day, the Mythical Development Beast is the only known possessor of these great skills to form a new crystal. <br /><br />Hidden in the shadows, the beast is waiting for the right opportunity to show his true form and to put his creativity, development and communication skills to the test.</h3>
